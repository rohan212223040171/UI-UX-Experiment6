## Aim:

To evaluate the user experience of two different digital platforms (a Health App and a Government Service Portal), identify UX problems, apply research methods, and create detailed user personas to guide design improvements.

## Algorithm:

Start

Select two different project scenarios (e.g., Health App and Government Portal).

Identify common user pain points for each scenario through observation or secondary data.

Write UX problem statements using a defined structure:
"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

Choose appropriate UX research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing).

Justify why each method fits the specific use case.

Based on research or user assumptions, create two user personas per scenario.

Include each persona’s demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations.

Compile all findings in a lab report.

Upload the project to GitHub and attach the lab report PDF.
